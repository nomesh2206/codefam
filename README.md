remove duplicate elements from an array in java.
it is a very basic but tricky task.
here we first sort the array ,
then count how many unique elements were present in an array.
after that comes the task of removing duplicate elements.
for this we use for loop and if statement.
we put the first element of unique array same as sorted array.
now compare 2 elements from beginning of sorted array at a time 
and if they are not equal we put second element in the unique array,
and if same do nothing or pass.
in this manner we find our unique array
and since our method is static we call it directly using class name.
